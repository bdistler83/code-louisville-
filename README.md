# code-louisville-

<h2>Description</h2>
	I have rebuilt my wifes Salons website. At the time of starting code louisville the website that they had was built using wordpress and getting hacked on the daily. Nothing was layed out in a way that you could find what you needed. I wanted to create something that was simple where a customer or potental customer could find the site and get what they are looking for right upfront, such as the contact info and well as an address.  The salon likes the minimalist approach and I wanted the website to stick with that same theme. I chose to add an email contact form with a message box so that visitors could ask a question online.

	only thing that you should have to do is download the file HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. once that is done open up the headzsalon.html file.
