<h2>Description</h2>
  I have rebuilt my wifes Salons website. At the time of starting code louisville the website that they had was built using wordpress and getting hacked on the daily. Nothing was layed out in a way that you could find what you needed. I believed that most people visit their website to figure out contact information and to get simple information like: 
        <li>Hours of operations</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>Address</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
              
   The salon likes the minimalist approach and I wanted the website to stick with that same theme. I chose to add an email contact form with a message box so that visitors could ask a question online as well.
